Comments on SpaceFood Project:

Environement consisting of 3-D Objects: Both our spaceship and space food (Apple) are 
3d models

User Control: You can controll the plane's roll, pitch, and yaw by using the 
QWEASD keys (WS control pitch, AD controls pitch, QE controls roll)

Objects Move Smoothly: Spaceship and Food Move smoothly

Texture Mapped Element: our food has a texture mapping. 

Lit 3-D Element: our apple is lit with diffuse lighting

Text overlay: We implemented a score counter which increases with the time the game 
is played for. 

Complex 3-D Element: our apple is not a simple 3D shape.
